# Data Modeling Project: Snowflake to Databricks Migration

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio's README, where I highlight a significant data modeling project I undertook involving the migration of data from Snowflake to Databricks. In response to cost considerations, the company made the strategic decision to transition its data environment, and I played a pivotal role in this transformative process. My responsibilities encompassed the comprehensive redesign of sales tables and the crucial task of standardizing data across the board.

## The Migration Challenge
As the organization embarked on the journey from Snowflake to Databricks, I was entrusted with the critical responsibility of reimagining the data landscape. My role involved restructuring sales tables to ensure a seamless transition, effectively translating data from one platform to another. The overarching goal was to optimize the migration process while maintaining data integrity and accuracy.

## Standardization for Accessibility
A compelling secondary objective emerged during the course of the project. It became evident that stakeholders faced difficulties in comprehending the data and extracting meaningful insights for analysis. Recognizing this challenge, I took the initiative to address it head-on. My efforts revolved around meticulously assessing data formatting and refining standards to guarantee clarity and accessibility.

## Key Achievements
