# Data Modeling Project: Snowflake to Databricks Migration

## Overview
Welcome to my portfolio's README, where I highlight a significant data modeling project I undertook involving the migration of data from Snowflake to Databricks. In response to cost considerations, the company made the strategic decision to transition its data environment, and I played a pivotal role in this transformative process. My responsibilities encompassed the comprehensive redesign of sales tables and the crucial task of standardizing data across the board.

## The Migration Challenge
As the organization embarked on the journey from Snowflake to Databricks, I was entrusted with the critical responsibility of reimagining the data landscape. My role involved restructuring sales tables to ensure a seamless transition, effectively translating data from one platform to another. The overarching goal was to optimize the migration process while maintaining data integrity and accuracy.

## Standardization for Accessibility
A compelling secondary objective emerged during the course of the project. It became evident that stakeholders faced difficulties in comprehending the data and extracting meaningful insights for analysis. Recognizing this challenge, I took the initiative to address it head-on. My efforts revolved around meticulously assessing data formatting and refining standards to guarantee clarity and accessibility.

## Key Achievements
1. Successfully orchestrated the migration of data from Snowflake to Databricks, mitigating potential disruptions and ensuring business continuity.
2. Revamped sales tables, aligning them with the requirements of the new platform and optimizing data flow.
3. Spearheaded the standardization initiative, resulting in data that is not only reliable but also comprehensible to diverse stakeholders.
   
## Conclusion
This data modeling project stands as a testament to my expertise in managing complex migrations and enhancing data accessibility. By bridging the gap between platforms and making data understandable, I contributed to the company's efficiency and decision-making processes.

##Observations
While reviewing this project, it's important to note that certain aspects of the code and data have been altered to preserve the confidentiality of the company. To uphold privacy and security measures, fictitious names have been used for tables and columns. These alterations were made with the utmost care to maintain the integrity of the project while safeguarding sensitive information.

By implementing these changes, I aim to demonstrate my commitment to ethical considerations and my dedication to maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary data. The fictitious elements in no way diminish the significance of the project's technical achievements and the strides made in data migration and accessibility.

I appreciate your understanding of these precautions and their significance in a real-world business context. If you have any inquiries regarding the methodology or specific technical aspects, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Thank you for your interest in exploring this project, and I'm available to provide any further insights or clarifications you may require.
